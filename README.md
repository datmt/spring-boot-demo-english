## Project Introduction

'Spring boot demo' is a project for deep learning and practical 'spring boot', currently containing a total of **'66'** integrated demos, has completed **'55'**.

The project has successfully integrated actuator ('monitoring'), admin ('visual monitoring'), logback ('logging'), aopLog ('logging web request logs via AOP'), unified exception handling ('json level and page level'), freemarker ('template engine'), thymeleaf ('template engine'), Beetl ('template engine'), Enjoy ('template engine'), JdbcTemplate ('Generic JDBC Operations Database'), JPA ('Powerful ORM Framework'), mybatis ('Powerful ORM Framework'), Universal Mapper ('Quick Manipulation Mybatis'), PageHelper ('Generic Mybatis Paging Plugin'), mybatis-plus ('Quick Manipulation Mybatis'), BeetlSQL ('Powerful ORRM Framework'), upload('Local File Upload and Qiniu Cloud File Upload'), redis ('Cache'), ehcache ('Cache'), email ('Send various types of email'), task ('Basic Scheduled Task'), quartz ('Dynamic Management Scheduled Task'), xxl-job ('Distributed Scheduled Task'), swagger ('API interface management test'), security ('RBAC-based dynamic permission authentication') ), SpringSession ('Session Sharing'), Zookeeper ('Combined with AOP for Distributed Locks'), RabbitMQ ('Message Queuing'), Kafka ('Message Queuing'), websocket ('Server Push Monitoring Server Operation Information'), socket.io ('Chat Room'), uReport2 ('Chinese-style Report'), packaged into 'war' files, integration ElasticSearch ('Basic Operations and Advanced Queries'), Async ('Asynchronous Tasks'), Integrated Dubbo ('Adopt Official Starter'), MongoDB ('Document Database'), neo4j ('Graph Database'), docker ('Containerized'), 'JPA Multiple Data Source', 'Mybatis Multidata Source', 'Code Generator', GrayLog ('Log Collection'), JustAuth ('Third Party Login'), LDAP ('Add, Delete, Delete'), 'Dynamically Add/Switch Data Sources', Stand-Alone Throttling ('AOP + Guava RateLimiter'), Distributed Throttling ('AOP + Redis + Lua'), ElasticSearch 7.x ('Using the Official Rest High Level Client''), HTTPS, Flyway ('Database Initialization'), UReport2(' Chinese-style complex reports').

> If you still have a demo that you want to integrate, you can also mention the requirements in [issue](https://github.com/xkcoding/spring-boot-demo/issues/new). I'll add it to the [TODO](./TODO.md) list. âœŠ

## Branch introduction

- Master branch: Based on Spring Boot version '2.1.0.RELEASE', the parent of each module depends on the pom .xml in the root directory, which is mainly used to manage the common dependent version of each module for everyone to learn.
- v-1.5.x branch: Based on Spring Boot version '1.5.8.RELEASE', each module depends on spring-boot-demo-parent, there are a lot of students who reflect that this method is not very friendly to novices, it is difficult to run, so *** This branch (v-1.5.x) will stop development and maintenance***, all content will slowly synchronize in the form of master branch, this branch is not completed Students who study in this branch can still learn in this branch, but it is recommended to switch to the master branch later, it will be easier, after all, the official has upgraded Spring Boot to version 2.x. ðŸ™‚

## Development environment

- **JDK 1.8 +**
- **Maven 3.5 +**
- **IntelliJ IDEA ULTIMATE 2018.2 +** (*Note: Be sure to use IDEA development while ensuring that the 'lombok' plugin is installed*)
- **Mysql 5.7+** (*Try to use version 5.7 or above, as version 5.7 adds some new features and is not backwards compatible.) This demo will try to avoid such incompatibilities, but it is recommended to ensure that version 5.7 or above is still possible*)

## How it works

> Tip: If you are a friend of the fork, please refer to the synchronization code: https://xkcoding.com/2018/09/18/how-to-update-the-fork-project.html

1. `git clone https://github.com/xkcoding/spring-boot-demo.git`
2. Use IDEA to open the project under clone
3. Import the 'pom.xml' file in the Maven Projects panel in IDEA
4. For children's shoes that Maven Projects can't find, you can check the View -> Tool Buttons on the toolbar at the top of IDEA, and then the Maven Projects panel will appear on the right side of IDEA
5. Find the Application class of each module to run each demo
6. **'Note: Each demo has a detailed README package, remember to look at the demo before eating Oh~'**
7. **'Note: Before running each demo, some need to initialize the database data in advance, don't forget Oh~'**
